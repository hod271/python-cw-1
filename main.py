# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8 
print(5 + 3)
# Write a print statement that uses the division operator / 
print ( 8 / 2 )
# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *
print ( 2 * 4 )
# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
length = 5
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width = 3
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
area = length * width 
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
print (f'the result is {area}')

# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables. 
print (f'is the length of the rectangle is {length} and the width is {width} then the area is {area}')
